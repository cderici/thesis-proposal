\subsection{Efficient self-hosting on a meta-tracing JIT is difficult}

While a meta-tracing JIT is able to make an interpreter for a language
substantially faster in general, it is however, quite difficult to
achieve a good performance when meta-tracing an interpreter evaluating
a large dispatch loop, such as another interpreter. Consequently, a
meta-tracing JIT compiler for a self-hosting programming language
implementation suffers a significant performance loss, since many
fundamental parts of a functional programming language implementation
often involves such big dispatch loops (e.g. reader, expander,
interpreter).
