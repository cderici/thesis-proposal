\subsection{Re-targetability through Linklets}
\label{subsec:linklets}

To address the issues described in the previous section, we move into
building a full implementation of self-hosting Racket on the RPython
framework. We will exploit the way that Racket made its implementation
easier to re-target different VMs via the \emph{linklets}. This
section explains what linklets are and how they work to evaluate
Racket modules and implement functionalities such as top-level, all
outside of the run-time implementation.
