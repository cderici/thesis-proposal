\subsection{Re-targetability through Linklets}
\label{subsec:linklets}

Now we make a step towards building a self-hosting Racket
implementation on the RPython framework. We will exploit the way that
Racket made its implementation easier to re-target different VMs via
the \emph{linklets}. This section explains what linklets are and how
they work to evaluate Racket modules and implement functionalities
such as top-level, all outside of the run-time implementation.
