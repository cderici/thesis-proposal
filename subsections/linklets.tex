\subsection{Language Portability via Linklets}
\label{subsec:linklets}

Linklets are lambda-like forms that consume and produce potentially
mutable variables (instead of values). They act as units of
compilation in Racket run-time, where for a given Racket module the
expander produces a bundle of linklets that will be consumed by the
run-time compiler. The following sections explain what linklets are
and how they work to evaluate Racket modules and implement
functionalities such as top-level, all outside of the run-time
implementation.
