\subsection{Performance Issues with Self-Hosting on JIT Compilers}
\label{subsec:performance}


Here's the technical details of the main issues about self-hosting on
meta-tracing.

\begin{itemize}
\item GC pressure on the heap (caused by long chain of continuations),
  talk about the depth of real world Racket programs like read, expand
  etc.

\item (main issue) Confused traces because of complex control flow
  (branchy dispatch loops)

  branchy code, with experiments, show traces
  
\end{itemize}
