\subsection{Performance Issues with Self-Hosting on JIT Compilers}
\label{subsec:performance}


Here's the technical details of the main issues about self-hosting on
meta-tracing.

\begin{itemize}
\item GC pressure on the heap... minimark GC (current) is three semispace generational GC (uses nursery for the young objects, mark \& sweep for olds)
  works well when
  - objects that die young...
  - most of the collected objs are newly created post the prev gc cycle


  the depth of real world Racket programs like
  read, expand etc doesn't play well with this

\item (main issue) Confused traces because of complex control flow
  (branchy dispatch loops)

  branchy code, with experiments, show traces
  
\end{itemize}
