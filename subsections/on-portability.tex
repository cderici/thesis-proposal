\subsubsection{On Portability}
\label{subsec:portability}

The ability to provide high-level functionalities as callable
functions to the hosting virual machine is one of the key ideas in
improving Racket's portability. A VM that wants to host Racket not
only gets the high-level implementations such as the module system,
macro system for free, but also gets highly re-usable functionalities
that it can integrate the systems it implements (such as the top-level
repl example in the previous section).

Moreover, Racket implements and exports abstract functionalities that
are tightly coupled with the hosting run-time as well. For instance
the expander linklet provides the \racketcode{eval} function, which is
basically an abstract interpreter for Racket. A VM that hosts Racket
can call \racketcode{eval}, which interprets Racket code by using the
primitives and \racketcode{compile-linklet}
and \racketcode{instantiate-linklet} that are implemented and provided
by the VM itself.

We will discuss a bit more on increasing the language portability in
\secref{subsec:pycket} where I will demonstrate this API in action on
Pycket.
