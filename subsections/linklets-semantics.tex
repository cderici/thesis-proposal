\subsubsection{Operational Semantics of Linklets}
\label{subsec:linklets-semantics}

For completeness, in this section I present a formalism to study the
operational semantics of linklets, which will be the basis of the
implementation on Pycket. The formalism is developed in the PLT Redex
language, therefore it is executable
\cite{felleisen2009semantics}. Randomized testing is used to verify
the model \cite{random-test:2009}, and a parallel test suite is used
to verify the Pycket implementation and the model with each other.
