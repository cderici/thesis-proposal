\cite{bolz15-meta-vm} stated that in general-purpose object-oriented
VMs, the compiler is op- timized for the language, or group of
languages, it was de- signed for. If a language’s semantics are
significantly differ- ent and thus do not fit the VM well, it will
perform poorly— despite a highly optimized underlying VM.


\cite{ast:12} argues that AST interpreters allow for much more
extensive modifications.

Another approach is to add support for dynamic lan- guages to an
existing high-performance static-language VM \cite{stJITdyn:12,
  dynStatComp:12}.
