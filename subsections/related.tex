\paragraph{Higher-order dynamic VMs}
Dynamic VM implementations are becoming increasingly popular for their
rapid prototyping potential, as the effort required to implement a new
VM from scratch is often quite large. Therefore, instead of manually
implementing a VM in a low-level language such as C, it is often
argued that building on top of an existing object-oriented
general-purpose VMs or dynamic integration via generating a VM using a
"specification" of a language allows easier and more maintainable
implementations with competitive performance
\cite{bolz_how_no:07}. One of the major actors for the former approach
is the \emph{GraalVM}, which is a modified version of the Java HotSpot
VM on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). GraalVM uses a language
implementation framework called Truffle, and a method-based JIT
compiler called Graal to implement VMs on the JVM for dynamic
languages such as Javascript, Ruby and Python \cite{graal:13}. As
opposed to building on top of VM, the \emph{RPython} project
introduced the idea of automatically generating a VM from a language
specification represented as an interpreter via meta-tracing
\cite{rpython07}. For example, as mentioned in the introduction, PyPy
is an implementation of Python that is built on the RPython
meta-tracing framework that generated a VM including a tracing JIT for
Python with a better performance than the CPython itself. In addition
to the RPython framework, there are other meta-tracing systems as
well, such as the SPUR, a tracing JIT compiler for CIL bytecode
\cite{miller2004common}, meta-tracing languages that are implemented
in C\# \cite{spur}.

\paragraph{Tracing JIT VMs}
Like PyPy, Pycket is built on the RPython meta-tracing framework as
well, and this study tries to identify approaches on achieving
efficient self-hosting on Pycket running a tracing JIT. Therefore it
would be relevant to mention here some notable tracing JIT VMs
too. Initially introduced by the Dynamo project \cite{dynamo},
trace-based compilation is successfully utilized by many VMs including
some commercial VMs such as Mozilla's TraceMonkey JavaScript VM
\cite{tracemonkey}, Adobe's Tamarin ActionScript VM \cite{tamarin}, as
well as some research VMs such as LuaJIT \cite{luajit:08}, Converge
\cite{converge:05}, Lambdamachine \cite{lambdamachine} and PyHaskell
\cite{pyhaskell}.

\paragraph{VM design and performance}
\cite{bolz15-meta-vm} stated that in general-purpose object-oriented
VMs, the compiler is optimized for the language, or group of
languages, it was designed for. If a language’s semantics are
significantly different and thus do not fit the VM well, it will
perform poorly— despite a highly optimized underlying VM.

\cite{ast:12} argues that AST interpreters allow for much more
extensive modifications.

Another approach is to add support for dynamic languages to an
existing high-performance static-language VM \cite{stJITdyn:12,
  dynStatComp:12}.
