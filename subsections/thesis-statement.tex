My thesis statement is:

\begin{quote}
  An efficient implementation of a self-hosting functional programming
  language is possible with on a meta-tracing JIT.
\end{quote}

I will support this thesis statement with the following research
contributions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{An implementation of self-hosting Racket on RPython.}
    I will demonstrate that Pycket has all the necessary run-time
    support (e.g. primitives, data structures, error handling etc.)
    to load and evaluate Racket code without requiring any external
    support, thereby being able to also run and pass a sufficiently
    big subset of Racket's own test suite, which consists of more than
    800.000 test cases.
  \item \textit{Approaches in achieving good performance} I will
    propose, demonstrate, evalauate and discuss some solution
    approaches that address the numerous performance issues that are
    fundamental to self-hosting a language such as Racket on a
    meta-tracing JIT compiler, such as garbage collection pressure on
    the heap caused by deep continuation chains on the interpreter,
    and the problem with tracing loops with complex control flow paths
    as discused above. I will vet the run-time performance of the
    proposed approaches on the improved Pycket and argue why these
    approaches enable a full and efficient implementation.

    %% Preliminary analyses indicate, however, there might be a
    %% more general problem that subsumes the aformentioned issues, which
    %% is that the amount of information that's been communicated between
    %% the interpreter and the run-time might not be not enough, for
    %% example for the JIT to maneuver around such a dispatch loop
    %% exercising a large number of branches.
